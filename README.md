# 🛡️ Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) – Windows Agent Project

## 📦 Project Overview

This project demonstrates configuring File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using Wazuh to monitor file changes on a Windows-based endpoint. The Wazuh agent was installed on a local Microsoft Windows system and configured to monitor the C:\Users\Public directory for file creation, modification, and deletion events.

All detected file integrity events were successfully validated through the Wazuh Web Interface (Wazuh Web Interface FIM Events tab).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Configure Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on a Windows agent

- Monitor sensitive directories for unauthorized file changes

- Validate real-time alerts through the Wazuh Dashboard

- Simulate real-world endpoint monitoring scenarios
